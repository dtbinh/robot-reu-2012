========================================================
   Robot Convoy (aka Ducklings aka Follow the Leader)
========================================================

This ROS package provides leader-follower behavior for a line of robots.
Robots require a Kinect or other color camera. Robots track a colored
target on the leader robot. Robots also communicate, and can send "stop"
and "start" commands to the others if they lose their target.



===== DEPENDENCIES =====

ROS Electric
irobot_mudd
communication_master


===== INSTALLATION =====

1) Move the source of this package to the ROS workspace folder

2) From inside the package, run rosmake.
   - If rosmake fails, 
     - check that the required packages are installed
     - check the CMakeCache.txt file in the build folder.  If it exists, 
       remove it and run rosmake again.



===== HOW TO LAUNCH =====

1) With your robot connected via USB, navigate to the launch folder inside the robot_convoy package and run:
	roslaunch robot_convoy.launch
   - This launch file will start roscore and run the kinect and irobot_mudd drivers.
   - If launch fails, try:
	1) Make sure your robot is connected and turned on
	2) Make sure your kinect is plugged in
	3) Run the command ls /dev/ at the command prompt
	   - Look for the listing starting with "ttyUSB"
	   - Make note of the number at the end (e.g. ttyUSB0)
	   - Check that this matches the port parameter inside the launch file under 
	     the irobot_mudd node line. If not, change the parameter to match
	     the port that is listed upon running ls /dev/.


2) Alternatively, run the following commands at the command prompt:
   - IN A NEW WINDOW: roscore
   - IN A NEW WINDOW: rosrun openni_camera openni_node
   - IN A NEW WINDOW: rosparam set /irobot_mudd/port /dev/ttyUSBx (e.g. ttyUSB0)
   		      rosrun irobot_mudd driver.py
   - IN A NEW WINDOW: rosrun robot_convoy Navigator.py



===== HOW TO USE =====

1) When everything is successfully connected and launched:
   - To put a robot in leader mode, first press 'A' to activate it.
     Then, press '1' to put it in leader mode. (Note: It should be on a white line
     so it has something to guide it!)
   - To put a robot in follower mode:
	- press 'a' to put the program in threshold-selection mode.
	- using the mouse, drag across the colored target to set thresholds.
	- if needed, press 'm' and drag across more areas to add to the threshold.
	- once the colored target is satisfactorily selected, press 'A' to activate
	  the robot.
	- then, press '2' to put the robot into follower mode.



===== COMMANDS =====

With any interface window selected, these commands are available:
	ESC/q   : quit
	h	: display help menu at command prompt
	s	: save thresholds to file
	l	: load thresholds from file
	c	: mousedrags will no longer set thresholds, kept values will be cleared
	a	: mousedrag will assign thresholds to area within drag
		  resets on new click and drag
	r	: mousedrags will remove the area under consideration
		  must have set an area in 'a' mode first
	m	: mousedrags will add the area under consideration
		  must have set an area in 'a' mode first
	t	: show total threshold image in threshold window
	A	: activate robot for moving, press A again to deactivate
	1 	: begin state machine as leader - follows lines
	2	: begin state machine as follower - tracks colors
